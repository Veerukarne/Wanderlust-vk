                        <p>Situated in the heart of the Thar Desert and close to the India-Pakistan border, Jaisalmer, founded in 1156 by Rawal Jaisal, is carpeted with golden sand and almost every house is built with the yellow Jaisalmer stone thus, making it the ‘Golden City’. The city still exudes an age-old aura of valor and royalty. Bold Rajasthani attires and the golden landscape of the city form a distinctive contrast. Jaisalmer literally meaning ‘the Hill Fort of Jaisal’ is a destination where camels are seen in abundance, an iconic hill-fort stands above the city with imposing walls where the best examples of par-brilliance inscriptions are found.</p>

                        <p>A landmark of the city, Howrah Bridge, constructed over the Hooghly river, is a huge steel bridge built during the British era. Believed to be one of the longest cantilever bridges in the world, this 705 meter structure links Howrah city to Kolkata and is fondly known as Howrah Bridge. Built in 1943, it was called the New Howrah Bridge. It is also called Rabindra Setu (it was named after Rabindranath Tagore in 1965 as a tribute to the great poet and the first Indian to win the Nobel prize). A photographer's delight, the bridge presents a picture of opulence when it is lit up at night. You can enjoy these splendid views by taking a ferry ride on the river.
