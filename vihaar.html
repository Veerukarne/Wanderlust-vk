            Enjoy the holidays
        </h1>
        <p>
            Everyone loves holidays, whether they are for one day or one month! Students especially look forward to their annual school vacation. They love that they don’t need to get up early for school and can get extra sleep hours. It’s a healthy break from a routine. Kids plan so many things for their holidays; some want to spend it with their cousins in their grandparent’s or relatives’ house.
